# arcdps-chat-log

Plugin for [arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) for doing various things with squad messages, such as persistent logs, notifications, and text to speech.

## Features

### Chat Log

Squad messages are logged into a database, allowing you to reference conversations with users. There is currently no support for reading the database while in-game.

### Squad Log

Squad activity is logged and viewable in-game, such as squad messages, squad joins/exits, subgroup changes, ready checks, combat status, and when squad members load into or exit from your instance.

### New message notification

Audio notifications can be played when a new squad message is received.
